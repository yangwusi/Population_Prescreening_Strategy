### A population precreening strategy for Kriging-assisted evolutionary algorithms [1]
The proposed algorithm generates multiple candidate populations in each generation and uses the multi-point expected improvement (qEI) [2] to prescreening these candidates for selecting the best population to work with.

The DACE toolbox [3] is used for building the Kriging models;
